# Fyers API Integration Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **API Endpoint URLs**
   - The application was using outdated API endpoints
   - Fyers API v3 has updated endpoints for quotes and historical data

2. **Authorization Header Format**
   - The authorization header must be in the format `appId:token`
   - The backend was not consistently formatting the token correctly

3. **Date Format for Historical Data**
   - The historical data endpoint requires dates in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - The application was using Unix timestamps

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated API Endpoints

- Changed quotes endpoint from `https://api-t1.fyers.in/data-rest/v2/quotes` to `https://api-t1.fyers.in/data/quotes`
- Changed historical data endpoint from `https://api-t1.fyers.in/data-rest/v2/history` to `https://api-t1.fyers.in/data/history`

### 2. Fixed Authorization Header Format

- Updated all API calls to ensure the authorization header is in the format `appId:token`
- Added code to check if the token already includes the appId, and if not, add it
- Ensured consistent handling of the token format across all services

### 3. Fixed Date Format for Historical Data

- Added date format conversion in the `marketDataService.js` file
- Created a helper function to convert Unix timestamps to YYYY-MM-DD format
- Ensured proper handling of date parameters in the historical data endpoint

## Files Modified

1. `server/liveMarketDataService.js`
   - Updated to use the correct quotes API endpoint
   - Fixed response data parsing to handle the new API response format

2. `server/marketDataService.js`
   - Updated to use the correct historical data API endpoint
   - Added date format conversion for timestamps
   - Fixed response data handling

3. `server/index.js`
   - Updated to properly format authorization headers
   - Added error handling for API calls

## Testing

We created several test scripts to verify the fixes:

1. `test-backend-quotes.js` - Tests the quotes endpoint through our backend
2. `test-backend-quotes-debug.js` - More detailed debugging for the quotes endpoint
3. `test-historical-data.js` - Tests the historical data endpoint
4. `test-fyers-direct-v3.js` - Tests direct API calls to Fyers API v3

All tests now pass successfully, confirming that the integration with Fyers API v3 is working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application for any further API-related issues
2. Consider implementing more robust error handling for API calls
3. Update the frontend to handle the new data formats if needed
