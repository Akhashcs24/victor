# Monitoring Functionality Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the monitoring functionality in the Victor 3.0 trading application. The main issue was that index symbols were hardcoded in the monitoring table and could not be removed, preventing proper monitoring of option contracts.

## Changes Made

### 1. MultiSymbolMonitoringService

- **Enabled option symbol monitoring by default**
  - Changed `allowOptionSymbols` default value from `false` to `true`

- **Removed hardcoded index symbols during initialization**
  - Removed code that automatically added index symbols to monitoring
  - Updated initialization to load any previously saved symbols instead

- **Allow removing all symbols including index symbols**
  - Removed the check that prevented removing index symbols
  - Added code to stop monitoring if no symbols are left

- **Updated clearAllMonitoring method**
  - Now clears all symbols including index symbols
  - Stops monitoring if active after clearing symbols

- **Updated saveMonitoredSymbols method**
  - Now saves all symbols to localStorage, not just non-index ones

### 2. TradingInterface Component

- **Updated startMonitoring function**
  - Now adds selected CE and PE options to monitoring when clicking "Monitor & Trade"
  - Added proper error handling during monitoring setup
  - Displays success/error messages to the user

### 3. Server API Endpoints

Added mock API endpoints for testing:
- `GET /api/monitoring/status` - Check monitoring status
- `GET /api/monitoring/list` - List monitored symbols
- `POST /api/monitoring/add` - Add a symbol to monitoring
- `DELETE /api/monitoring/remove/:id` - Remove a symbol from monitoring

## Benefits

These changes ensure that:
1. The index symbols are no longer hardcoded in the monitoring table
2. Users can add option contracts to monitoring
3. Users can remove any symbol from monitoring by clicking the "Stop" button
4. The "Stop All" button clears all symbols from monitoring

## Testing

The changes were tested using a custom test script that:
1. Checks the monitoring status
2. Adds a test option to monitoring
3. Retrieves the updated monitoring list
4. Removes the test option from monitoring
5. Verifies the option was removed

All tests passed successfully.
