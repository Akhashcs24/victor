# Victor: HMA-55 Trading App Requirements (Optimized with Manual Control)

## Overview
This is a personal-use web+mobile trading app built using Fyers API. The app monitors a single HMA-55 crossover strategy on ATM options of Nifty 50, Bank Nifty, or Sensex. It includes manual intervention points to reduce API load and enhance stability.

## 1. Authentication
- User enters:
  - App ID
  - Secret
  - Redirect URI
- App generates an Auth Link ‚Üí opens in a new tab for login
- User returns and manually enters the Auth Code
- App exchanges code for access token
- Header shows Auth Status, Token Validity, and API Health

---

## 2. Manual Data Control
To avoid hitting Fyers API rate limits:
- **Contract Selection**:
  - User manually enters the CE and PE option symbols (e.g., `NSE:NIFTY24500CE`, `NSE:NIFTY24500PE`)
- **Historical Data**:
  - User clicks "Fetch HMA Data" button
  - App fetches last 55 candles of 5-min data and calculates HMA-55
- **Open Price**:
  - User manually clicks "Lock Open Price" to fetch and display open prices for all indexes
  - Calculated ATM is shown but not enforced

- Quantity input for each leg
- Target/SL inputs (Points or Percentage)
- Entry method dropdown: Market / Limit
- Buttons:
  - "Fetch HMA Data"
  - "Start Monitoring"

#### C. Strategy Monitoring Cards (2 Cards)

---

## 4. Strategy Logic
- Monitor 1-min candle close LTPs for both CE and PE contracts
- If 1-min candle closes above the latest 5-min HMA-55 ‚Üí entry
- Place entry as Market or Limit order based on user selection
- SL/Target are tracked by the app, exit by sending a Limit Order
- App must maintain status and error recovery (retry on fail, alert on expiry)

---

## 5. Technology
- Tailwind CSS for clean, minimal UI
- React (Web+Mobile ready)
- Fyers v3 API integration
- Cursor-based development
- Deployment-ready for personal hosting (optional)

---

## 6. Limits and Safety
- Fyers API: 10/sec, 200/min, 100k/day
- No automatic scanning or polling unless user clicks an action
- Monitoring uses 1 API call per minute per contract only after user triggers it
- System must pause monitoring if token expires

---

## 7. Future Scope
- Live charts, WebSocket support
- Automated strike selector based on open price
- Multi-strategy engine
